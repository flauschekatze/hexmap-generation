# Hex Map Generation

Shortly, you'll find some musings on the generation of hex maps here. For now, though, it's all a bit empty until I write up what I've learned and tidy my atrocious Perl code enough to be readable. Watch this space.

### Current TODO:

* Island Shapes (pen, paper and d6)
* Make gifs
* Clean & release Perl stuff
